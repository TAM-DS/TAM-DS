# Tracy Manning
**Senior/Staff-Level FinOps & Multicloud AI Systems Architect**  
Production MLOps • Multicloud Infrastructure • AI-Native Cost Optimization • Austin, TX

I architect and deliver production-grade AI systems that are reliable, observable, and ruthlessly cost-efficient — the kind that keep delivering value at 3 a.m. when models scale unexpectedly, cloud bills spike, or multicloud complexity threatens to derail everything.

My focus: turning AI ambition into sustainable, production reality. I design multicloud architectures where FinOps is baked in from day one — not bolted on later — ensuring teams get maximum business value without runaway spend. I care deeply about how systems behave in the real world: predictable costs, automated governance, intelligent optimization, and decisions that align technical excellence with financial accountability.

> "Build systems that must work — then make them cost less than anyone expects. Iterate relentlessly. Measure everything. Optimize for the long game."

# What I Build & Deliver

**FinOps-Driven Multicloud AI Architecture**

- End-to-end multicloud platforms (AWS, GCP, Azure, Databricks) designed for AI workloads with native cost governance, tagging strategies, and automated commitments/reservations
- AI-powered FinOps systems: predictive cost modeling, anomaly detection, real-time optimization, and unit economics that reveal true spend per model, pipeline, or team
- Cloud-agnostic architectures that eliminate vendor lock-in while maximizing discounts, spot/preemptible usage, and cross-cloud rightsizing for GPU-heavy AI inference/training

**Production MLOps & Agentic AI Delivery**

- Reliable agentic AI and RAG pipelines deployed at scale: secure, observable, auto-remediating, with built-in cost controls
- Model serving, inference optimization, and hybrid batch/streaming workflows tuned for throughput, latency, and dollar-per-query efficiency
- Linux-native, Kubernetes-first MLOps platforms using Terraform IaC — production runs on hardened kernels and observability, not fragile notebooks

**Data Engineering & Pipelines at Scale**

- Petabyte-scale, cost-optimized data pipelines (Bronze → Silver → Gold medallion) with heavy SQL craftsmanship for transformation, analytics, and feature stores
- Streaming + batch systems engineered for predictable spend: intelligent partitioning, auto-scaling, and FinOps-aware design that reduces bills by architecture, not after-the-fact firefighting
- Multicloud data architectures with unified governance, lineage, and cost attribution across providers

# Side Projects & Forward Bets
Pushing the edges to stay ahead of the curve:

- **QuantConnect-Powered Quant Pipelines** — Building production-ready algorithmic trading workflows on QuantConnect: backtesting multicloud cost-optimized strategies, integrating real-time data pipelines, SQL-driven feature engineering, and MLOps for live deployment. Focus: FinOps-aware quant systems that scale profitably without exploding compute spend.
- **Quantum-Enhanced Optimization Experiments** — Prototyping quantum-inspired algorithms (e.g., for portfolio optimization, anomaly detection in FinOps, or multicloud resource allocation) using classical simulators and QuantConnect baselines. Exploring how quantum advantages could supercharge cost governance and agentic decision-making in AI infra by 2030+.

# Core Principles I Bring to Every System
- **FinOps maturity from day zero** — visibility, allocation, optimization, and continuous forecasting embedded in design
- **Production mindset** — systems are built to survive chaos, with SLOs, alerting, chaos engineering, and rollback as table stakes
- **Intelligent cost engineering** — treat dollars as a first-class metric alongside accuracy and speed
- **Multicloud fluency** — seamless portability, best-of-breed selection, and unified observability across clouds
