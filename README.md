**Senior/Staff-Level FinOps & Multicloud AI Systems Architect**  
**Client-Facing Strategist & CX Transformation Leader**  
**Production MLOps • Multicloud Infrastructure • AI-Native Cost Optimization • Austin, TX**

I architect and deliver production-grade AI systems that are reliable, observable, and ruthlessly cost-efficient — the kind that keep delivering value at 3 a.m. when models scale unexpectedly, cloud bills spike, or multicloud complexity threatens to derail everything.

My focus: turning AI ambition into a sustainable, production reality — **with the customer always the ultimate goal**. Every architecture, pipeline, cost model, and decision must serve real people — their trust, their outcomes, their day-to-day reality. Getting it right for them isn't a nice-to-have; it's the north star that guides every choice.

I design multicloud architectures where FinOps is engineered in from day one — not bolted on after the invoice arrives — so teams capture maximum business value without runaway spend. I care deeply about how systems behave in the real world: predictable costs, automated governance, intelligent optimization, and decisions that align technical excellence with financial accountability and long-term customer trust.

Because in the end, the most powerful system isn’t the one with the highest benchmark.  
It’s the one that quietly pays for itself — while making customers feel truly seen, supported, and valued every step of the way.

> **Quick 2025 context**  
Early-year contributions were lighter (Jan–Jul) while I provided full-time home hospice care for my mom during her battle with brain cancer. Family came first—it was my choice and exactly where I needed to be. That chapter sharpened my focus under extreme pressure and reinforced why I build systems that must survive chaos. Grateful to be back shipping at full strength: quantum FinOps prototypes, QuantConnect cost-aware quant pipelines, orbital AI security analysis, and multicloud agentic infra.

# What I Build & Deliver

**FinOps-Driven Multicloud AI Architecture**

- End-to-end multicloud platforms (AWS, GCP, Azure, Databricks) designed for AI workloads with native cost governance, tagging strategies, and automated commitments/reservations
- AI-powered FinOps systems: predictive cost modeling, anomaly detection, real-time optimization, and unit economics that reveal true spend per model, pipeline, or team
- Cloud-agnostic architectures that eliminate vendor lock-in while maximizing discounts, spot/preemptible usage, and cross-cloud rightsizing for GPU-heavy AI inference/training

**Production MLOps & Agentic AI Delivery**

- Reliable agentic AI and RAG pipelines deployed at scale: secure, observable, auto-remediating, with built-in cost controls
- Model serving, inference optimization, and hybrid batch/streaming workflows tuned for throughput, latency, and dollar-per-query efficiency
- Linux-native, Kubernetes-first MLOps platforms using Terraform IaC — production runs on hardened kernels and observability, not fragile notebooks

**Data Engineering & Pipelines at Scale**

- Petabyte-scale, cost-optimized data pipelines (Bronze → Silver → Gold medallion) with heavy SQL craftsmanship for transformation, analytics, and feature stores
- Streaming + batch systems engineered for predictable spend: intelligent partitioning, auto-scaling, and FinOps-aware design that reduces bills by architecture, not after-the-fact firefighting
- Multicloud data architectures with unified governance, lineage, and cost attribution across providers
  
# Side Projects & Forward Bets
Pushing the edges to stay ahead of the curve — interconnected bets on where multicloud FinOps, agentic MLOps, and cost engineering head next: from Earth-bound optimization to quantum-accelerated edges to physics-enforced orbital dominance.
- **QuantConnect-Powered Quant Pipelines** — Building production-ready algorithmic trading workflows on QuantConnect: backtesting multicloud cost-optimized strategies, integrating real-time data pipelines, SQL-driven feature engineering, and MLOps for live deployment. Focus: FinOps-aware quant systems that scale profitably without exploding compute spend. (6-project series in progress.)
- **Quantum-Enhanced Optimization Experiments** — Prototyping quantum-inspired and hybrid quantum-classical algorithms for portfolio optimization, anomaly detection in FinOps, multicloud resource allocation, and classification tasks using classical simulators and Qiskit/PyTorch. Exploring how quantum advantages could supercharge cost governance and agentic decision-making in AI infra by 2030+.

  - Hybrid Quantum-Classical Classifier: Minimal HQNN (Qiskit EstimatorQNN + PyTorch TorchConnector) achieving **100% test accuracy** on make_moons → https://github.com/TAM-DS/Quantum-Hybrid-Moons-Classifier  
  - VQE Ground-State Energy Demo: Computing H₂ ground state in STO-3G basis using UCCSD ansatz + Hartree-Fock initial state. Reaches **chemical accuracy** (~ -1.852 Hartree, error <1 mHa vs exact classical) → https://github.com/TAM-DS/Quantum-Chemistry-VQE-H2  
  - Additional quantum prototypes (cleanups in progress): [Quantum Project 3 Name/Link]
- **Orbital AI Security & Infrastructure Analysis** — Comprehensive framework modeling the shift to space-based AI: physics/economics of orbital compute (free radiative cooling, solar efficiency, tipping point at <$50/kg launch), threat propagation (RAG vuln 0.79 in retrieval layer), control strain under latency (human-in-loop fails at 0.91 via 100k Monte Carlo sims), and value inversion (autonomous control captures 92%). Predicting 25-40% exascale AI training in orbit by 2034-2037. Core insight: Continuity guaranteed by autonomy owns the orbital economy.

# Core Principles I Bring to Every System
- **FinOps maturity from day zero** — visibility, allocation, optimization, and continuous forecasting embedded in design
- **Production mindset** — systems are built to survive chaos, with SLOs, alerting, chaos engineering, and rollback as table stakes
- **Intelligent cost engineering** — treat dollars as a first-class metric alongside accuracy and speed
- **Multicloud fluency** — seamless portability, best-of-breed selection, and unified observability across clouds

## Platforms & Credentials
- AWS Solutions Architect – Professional (SAP)
- Google Cloud Professional Machine Learning Engineer
- Databricks Machine Learning Professional
- FinOps Certified Practitioner 

Let's talk production AI that pays for itself—and gets quantum-ready. 🚀
## Harvard alum.
- Builder of systems that must work in production — iterate relentlessly, measure everything, eliminate toil, and optimize ruthlessly for scale and cost. Because great just isn’t good enough; build for the long game.
